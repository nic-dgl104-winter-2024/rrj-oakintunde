# Week 8 February 26th - Read the Research and Reflection Assignment
Make sure to visit the description of the Research & Reflection assignment on Brightspace. You should read the assignment description and the rubric in details to familiarize yourself with expectations.

## 1
I started delving further into functional user requirements today, with an emphasis on user stories and how they influence software development. I began by learning the basic idea behind user stories, which are succinct, user-focused summaries of software features presented from the viewpoint of the final user. These narratives outline the functions that the user requires the system to do and act as the foundation for functional user requirements.
## 2
As I learned more, I came to understand how crucial it is to write user stories that are precise, quantifiable, and unambiguous. Every user narrative has a goal, an action, and a user role in an organised manner. Stakeholders benefit from this clarity, especially developers and designers. efficiently assimilate the demands and expectations of the user. Additionally, user stories are frequently written in a style that promotes better communication among team members who are technical and non-technical.
## 3
The idea of the "INVEST" criteria for user stories—Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable—rose to prominence during my education. By following these guidelines, user stories are guaranteed to be clearly defined, and manageable, and greatly enhance the system's overall functionality. Observing how these ideas improve the effectiveness of agile development methods was fascinating.

## 4
I then looked at how functional user requirements translate from user stories into comprehensive functional specifications that serve as a roadmap for the development team. The behaviour, interactions, and functional needs of the system are described. features that are determined by the user stories. During this stage, features are prioritised according to business value, approval criteria are defined, and user stories are broken down into manageable tasks.

## 5:
The iterative process of establishing functional user requirements was one of the most important lessons I learned during my learning process. Ensuring software alignment with user needs and expectations requires ongoing feedback loops, stakeholder interaction, and requirement modification. Agile approaches frequently use this iterative approach, which encourages flexibility and responsiveness to changing requirements.

## In summary:
To sum up, I have learned a lot about functional user requirements, particularly how user stories become comprehensive functional specifications. I now recognise the value of clear and succinct communication through user stories, the collaborative nature of establishing user needs, and the software development projects' successful iterative refining process. My understanding of the delicate balance that must be struck between user-centric design and technical implementation in order to create effective software solutions has grown as a result of this adventure.

## Activity 2 - Research a new language (Wyvern)
* What is the purpose of the language?
The purpose of the programming language Wyvern is to create safe and modular software systems. It focuses on giving language-based security significant support so that developers can make reliable and secure apps.

* Who uses the language?
Researchers and developers interested in language-based security, secure software design, and composability are the main users of Wyvern. It's also used in academics to investigate secure programming language principles for educational reasons.

* Which resources are helpful?
To get started with Wyvern, visit the official website at wyvernlang.github.io, which provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and starting points. Furthermore, the source code, examples, and community debates can be accessed through the GitHub repository (github.com/wyvernlang/wyvern).

* What makes these particular resources valuable?
An organised introduction to Wyvern, including its features, syntax, and design concepts, may be found on the official website. It provides as a foundation for comprehending the language's potential and learning how to utilise it efficiently. In addition, the GitHub repository is a great resource for learning and development because it provides real-world examples, issue tracking, and chances for community participation within the Wyvern community.


"Are you familiar with Wyvern? It is a programming language with an emphasis on composability and language-based security. Wyvern is frequently used by researchers, developers, and educators who are interested in safe software design and instruction. Visit the official Wyvern website for tutorials and documentation, and sign up for the GitHub repository to access samples and engage in community outreach."

## Activity 3 - Write a user story (Spotify)
## For my app user story, I choose Spotify. 
* "As a user of the "Spotify" app, I can create and manage playlists to organize my favourite songs".
* "As a user of the "Spotify" app, I can discover new music through curated playlists based on my listening preferences."
* "As a user of the "Spotify" app, I can collaborate on playlists with friends to create shared music experiences."

## Acceptance criteria for the last of these user stories may include:
* The app includes a "Create Playlist" button in the playlists section.
* The app provides visibility into who contributed which songs to the collaborative playlist.
* The app provides options to save or follow recommended playlists for future listening.
* The app allows me to delete or rename playlists as needed.

## Activity 4 - Choose a language for community code
## Outcome
Examine Java for the Community Code Project.
After giving the language selections for the Community Code project some thought, I'm thinking of learning more about JavaScript. Even though I've done school projects on it for the past two years, I think there's always more to learn, especially in a setting that focuses on the community.

The flexibility and extensive use of JavaScript are one particular reason I'd like to learn more about it. JavaScript is perfect for creating scalable and reliable apps because of its large ecosystem and abundance of tools and frameworks. Furthermore, improving my knowledge of Java would help me both personally and in terms of my ability to make more meaningful contributions to open-source projects in our community.

I'm interested in hearing your opinions and recommendations on this!

## Activity 5 - Star GitHub topics repositories of interest
Exploring GitHub and giving stars is a new practice, I have learnt to gain knowledge regarding different open-source communities and their latest trends. Also, giving stars to interesting topics will be useful for us in future to stay updated for potential learnings.

To complete this task, I explored the following:

* [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)
* [GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics)
* [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending)
* [GitHub Collections](https://github.com/collections)

## Reflections
Studying programming languages and reading other people's postings has taught me a few intriguing things, like how many different languages there are, each with special advantages and uses. Python appeals to me for DGL 104 because of its flexibility, ease of learning, and plenty of libraries. Because JavaScript is so widely used in web development and can be used to construct interactive interfaces, it would be my second option. I was aback by the wide variety of projects seen in GitHub repositories, ranging from straightforward tools to intricate systems. I discovered that using contemporary frameworks or tools, actively contributing to the community, and having well-documented code were all common.

# Week 9 (March 5)
## Activity 1 - Read the Community Code Assignment
Make sure to visit the description of the Community Code assignment on Brightspace. You should read the assignment description and the rubric in detail to familiarize yourself with expectations.
## Result
There are two components to this assignment, which promote practising effective coding by getting involved in two open-source groups. While it is required to contribute to both sections, only one section can be involved in the code. Also, rather than finishing each section in turn, both should be finished at the same time.
* Part 1: Enhance code documentation, respond to inquiries, write tutorials, translate code, and work on GitHub problems to make a genuine contribution to an open-source community. Make improvements, fork the project, and record your input.
* Part 2: Add to a library of patterns related to software design and architecture for DGL 104 students. This entails generating CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md files as well as overseeing contributions via pull requests and problems.
Two parts of the rubric are used to evaluate contributions: Part 1 is for external open-source communities, while Part 2 is for internal use.

## Activity 2 - How to contribute to open source
There are two components to this assignment, which promote practising effective coding by getting involved in two open-source groups. While it is required to contribute to both sections, only one section can be involved in the code. Also, rather than finishing each section in turn, both should be finished at the same time.

* Part 2: Add to a library of patterns related to software design and architecture for DGL 104 students. This entails generating CONTRIBUTING.md and README files as well as overseeing contributions via pull requests and problems.

Two parts of the rubric are used to evaluate contributions: Part 1 is for external open-source communities, while Part 2 is for internal use. Improvements, bug fixes, and performance enhancements in open-source projects about artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

* Documentation Improvement: The success of open-source projects depends on having thorough and understandable documentation. I can help by improving documentation, penning tutorials, and producing user manuals to help projects become more approachable for beginners.
* Community Engagement: Maintaining open-source projects requires creating a vibrant and friendly community. I would like to help with community management tasks including planning events, leading conversations, and coaching new members.
Looking for a project to work on Using GitHub Investigate and Make Available Sources Friday had a tonne of projects in a lot of different categories. I discovered projects with a variety of technologies and objectives, from easy for beginners to difficult. Analysing these initiatives allowed me to comprehend the improvements, bug fixes, and performance enhancements in open-source projects about artificial intelligence and natural language processing.
* Documentation Improvement: The success of open-source projects depends on having thorough and understandable documentation. I can help by improving documentation, penning tutorials, and producing user manuals to help projects become more approachable for beginners.
 various chances for contributions and the significance of identifying a project that fits my interests and skill set.
* Thought on project exploration: I discovered popular and vibrant communities for projects like TensorFlow, VSCode, and Pandas throughout my exploration. Smaller initiatives concentrating on specialised fields like educational materials and accessibility tools were also revealed to me. The notion that there is a project for everyone, regardless of skill level, was strengthened by this experience and that finding the appropriate fit is key to contributing to open source.

In conclusion, I now have a deeper grasp of open source contributions thanks to my investigation of projects and my trip through the Open Source Guides. I can't wait to share my expertise and experience to improve open-source initiatives, encourage teamwork, and benefit the community.

## Activity 3 - Find Potential Projects to Contribute to
ask Involved
* Task 1 - Identifying and selecting open-source repositories from platforms like Good First Issues, Up for Grabs, and CodeTriage that align with your interests and skill set.
* Task 2 - Analyzing the selected projects by reviewing available issues, understanding their requirements, discussing potential solutions with the community, and preparing contributions such as code changes or documentation updates.
* Task 3 - Using the checklist helps figure out if any of the projects are a good match. This makes it easier to pick three projects that are relevant to us.
* Task 4 - Take a screenshot when you have completed all checklist questions.

## Activity 4 - Explore community connections
## Task
* Research community connections and Identify primary community platforms (Discord, Slack, Zulip) for open-source projects.
* Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the community.
* Follow as many relevant links from the repository back to potential communities that you can find (this might include looking carefully at maintainer GitHub profiles, websites and socials).
* Write a summary of your discoveries in your Research and Reflection Journal.

## Result
In my exploration of community connections for open-source projects, I focused on platforms like Discord, Slack, and Zulip, which are commonly used for fostering collaboration and communication among contributors. Here's a summary of my discoveries:

## Discord:
* Discord has become a popular platform for open-source communities due to its ease of use and various communication features.
Many open-source projects host Discord servers where contributors can chat, ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate in real-time.
I found several open-source project repositories on GitHub that linked to their Discord servers in the README or CONTRIBUTING.md files.
Examples include gaming-related projects, developer tools, and community-driven initiatives.
* Slack:
While Slack was once widely used for open-source communities, its popularity has somewhat declined in favor of other platforms like Discord.
Nevertheless, some open-source projects still maintain Slack workspaces for communication and collaboration.
I encountered Slack links in older repositories or projects affiliated with organizations that prefer Slack for internal communications.

## Zulip:
Zulip is gaining traction as a communication platform for open-source communities, particularly those that value threaded conversations and topic-based organization.
It's often used by projects that require structured discussions and searchable archives.
Although less common than Discord or Slack, I came across a few open-source projects that use Zulip for their community interactions.
Community Connections:
During my research, I delved into various open-source project repositories and followed links to potential community platforms. I also explored maintainer GitHub profiles, project websites, and social media channels to gather information about community engagement.

## Reflection:
I observed a trend where newer and more active open-source projects tend to favour Discord for its real-time communication features and vibrant community engagement. Slack, while still used by some projects, appears to be less prevalent in the open-source ecosystem compared to a few years ago. Zulip, with its focus on organized discussions, appeals to projects that prioritize structured communication.

Overall, my discoveries highlight the importance of community platforms in facilitating collaboration, knowledge sharing, and engagement within open-source communities. Each platform has its strengths, and the choice often depends on the project's needs and the preferences of contributors.
This research experience has deepened my understanding of community connections in open source and reinforced the significance of fostering inclusive and active communities for sustainable project growth.
I compiled this information based on general trends and observations in the open-source community. If you need specific examples or details about particular projects or platforms, I can delve deeper into those areas as well.

## Activity 5 - Identify issues to support
These are the steps taken to complete this activity:
* Visit the GitHub repository for each of the three projects identified in the previous activity.
* Open the "Issues" tab within each repository.
* Take note of the different tags available under the "Labels" dropdown menu.
* Look for tags such as "good first issue" or "help wanted" among others.
* Read through the issues tagged with "good first issue" or "help wanted" (or any other interesting tags).
* Identify at least one issue that you feel you could contribute to.
* Write a summary of the issue in your Research and Reflection Journal. include the URL of the issue, a brief description of the problem, and how you think you can contribute or where you would start.
* Summarize any discussions already present in the issue between community members.

## Result
To complete this activity, I thoroughly reviewed the issues in my chosen project repositories, filtering them by labels such as "help wanted" and "good first issue." From various available issues, I selected these three that align with my skills and interests.

## Project 1: Prayer Times Menubar App

[Here you can find the issues here](https://github.com/b0bdN/prayer-times-menubar-app/issues/3)
Label: Enhancement, New feature, Help Wanted

Issue description - The issue was opened by user "b0bdN" on Feb 15, 2022, expressing that the function getNextPrayer() in renderer.js can be better. The aim is to show the next prayer with the difference between the prayer time and the actual time. Also to add more language translation on the app.

Contribution - [Wrote JSON language translation for Pakistan, Nigerian (Yoruba language) and Italian](https://github.com/b0bdN/prayer-times-menubar-app/issues/26)
Conversations - 

## Project 2: Light house

Here you can find the issue - [Add Applause-button to swag items #104
](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/15891)
Label: docs, P2

Issue description - The issue was opened by user "ChristopherPHolder" in March 2024, lighthouse is exposing a method called startTimespan and unable to find any documentation on it: user-flow docs.

Contribution - made the timespan work
```
import { startTimespan } from 'lighthouse';
import { launch } from "puppeteer";
import { writeFileSync } from "fs";

const browser = await launch({headless: false});
const page = await browser.newPage();

await page.goto('https://web.dev/');

const timespan = await startTimespan(page);

await page.click('button[search-open]');
const searchBox = await page.waitForSelector('devsite-search[search-active] input');
await searchBox?.type('CLS');
await searchBox?.press('Enter');

// Ensure search results have rendered before moving on.
await page.waitForSelector('devsite-content a[href="https://web.dev/articles/cls"]');

const timespanResults = await timespan.endTimespan();

// Save results as JSON.
writeFileSync('timespan-result.json', JSON.stringify(timespanResults, null, 2));

await browser.close();
```

Conversations - They discuss the node equivalent of running timespan mode in the DevTools panel. A flow you need to call flow.startTimespan to get timespan results in the flow report.

## Project 3: Storybook
Here you can find the issue - More clarity on what including compodoc does?#24944

Label: angular, cli, documentation, good first issue, help wanted

Issue description - The issue was opened by user fireflysemantics on Nov 21, 2023, who requested more documentation on what including Compodoc does in the Angular CLI. The user noted that when setting up an Angular project with Storybook, the CLI asks if users want to use Compodoc, but there isn't enough clarity on its functionality.

Contribution - There is need to work on improving the clarity of Compodoc's documentation within Angular CLI.

Conversations - The labels like "good first issue" and "help wanted," this presents an accessible opportunity for newcomers to contribute. The ongoing conversation revolves around understanding Compodoc's role, with key contributors providing insights into its functionality and interaction with Storybook.

I decided to work on the issue of storybook project for contribution in my community code part 1.
