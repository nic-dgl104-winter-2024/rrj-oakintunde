# 1
I started delving further into functional user requirements today, with an emphasis on user stories and how they influence software development. I began by learning the basic idea behind user stories, which are succinct, user-focused summaries of software features presented from the viewpoint of the final user. These narratives outline the functions that the user requires the system to do and act as the foundation for functional user requirements.
# 2
As I learned more, I came to understand how crucial it is to write user stories that are precise, quantifiable, and unambiguous. Every user narrative has a goal, an action, and a user role in an organised manner. Stakeholders benefit from this clarity, especially developers and designers. efficiently assimilate the demands and expectations of the user. Additionally, user stories are frequently written in a style that promotes better communication among team members who are technical and non-technical.
# 3
The idea of the "INVEST" criteria for user stories—Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable—rose to prominence during my education. By following these guidelines, user stories are guaranteed to be clearly defined, and manageable, and greatly enhance the system's overall functionality. Observing how these ideas improve the effectiveness of agile development methods was fascinating.

# 4
I then looked at how functional user requirements translate from user stories into comprehensive functional specifications that serve as a roadmap for the development team. The behaviour, interactions, and functional needs of the system are described. features that are determined by the user stories. During this stage, features are prioritised according to business value, approval criteria are defined, and user stories are broken down into manageable tasks.

# 5:
The iterative process of establishing functional user requirements was one of the most important lessons I learned during my learning process. Ensuring software alignment with user needs and expectations requires ongoing feedback loops, stakeholder interaction, and requirement modification. Agile approaches frequently use this iterative approach, which encourages flexibility and responsiveness to changing requirements.

# In summary:
To sum up, I have learned a lot about functional user requirements, particularly how user stories become comprehensive functional specifications. I now recognise the value of clear and succinct communication through user stories, the collaborative nature of establishing user needs, and the software development projects' successful iterative refining process. My understanding of the delicate balance that must be struck between user-centric design and technical implementation in order to create effective software solutions has grown as a result of this adventure.

# Activity 2 - Research a new language (Wyvern)
* What is the purpose of the language?
The purpose of the programming language Wyvern is to create safe and modular software systems. It focuses on giving language-based security significant support so that developers can make reliable and secure apps.

* Who uses the language?
Researchers and developers interested in language-based security, secure software design, and composability are the main users of Wyvern. It's also used in academics to investigate secure programming language principles for educational reasons.

* Which resources are helpful?
To get started with Wyvern, visit the official website at wyvernlang.github.io, which provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and starting points. Furthermore, the source code, examples, and community debates can be accessed through the GitHub repository (github.com/wyvernlang/wyvern).

* What makes these particular resources valuable?
An organised introduction to Wyvern, including its features, syntax, and design concepts, may be found on the official website. It provides as a foundation for comprehending the language's potential and learning how to utilise it efficiently. In addition, the GitHub repository is a great resource for learning and development because it provides real-world examples, issue tracking, and chances for community participation within the Wyvern community.


"Are you familiar with Wyvern? It is a programming language with an emphasis on composability and language-based security. Wyvern is frequently used by researchers, developers, and educators who are interested in safe software design and instruction. Visit the official Wyvern website for tutorials and documentation, and sign up for the GitHub repository to access samples and engage in community outreach."
